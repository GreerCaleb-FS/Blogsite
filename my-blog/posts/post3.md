Connecting multiple APIs into your app can really expand on your functionality.

## Why Link APIs?

APIs excel at adding more data and workflow into your platform. This should help you build out a better user experience. A good and common example of this would be linking a Weather API with a Maps API. If you put these two together you could quickly build out a weather app!
